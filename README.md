You can use a remote device to control the slides.

There is a "Use device as remote" button in the sidemenu of the application.

While having your presentation open [go to this url](http://piatra.github.io/kreator.js/output/remote.html) copy the given code and enter it in the box that appears when you click "Use device as remote". You will then be able to change the slides from your phone. You also have a timer to keep track of your progress.
